# Deployment Guide: Hybrid Worker Architecture

This guide walks you through deploying the complete IMDb scraper solution using the hybrid worker architecture.

## Overview

The solution consists of two parts:
1. **Vercel App**: Fast Next.js API and Stremio addon serving (existing)
2. **Railway Worker**: Dedicated browser automation service (new)

This architecture solves the serverless browser automation limitation while keeping optimal performance.

## Phase 1: Set Up Upstash Redis (Free)

1. **Create Upstash Account**:
   - Go to [upstash.com](https://upstash.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub (free)

2. **Create Redis Database**:
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Name: `imdb-scraper-queue`
   - Region: Choose closest to your users
   - Type: Select "Free" tier
   - Click "Create"

3. **Get Connection URL**:
   - Copy the "UPSTASH_REDIS_URL" from the database dashboard
   - It looks like: `rediss://default:xxx@xxx.upstash.io:6379`

## Phase 2: Deploy Worker to Railway

1. **Create Railway Account**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Deploy from Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Deploy entire repo (Railway will detect scraper-worker folder)
   railway login
   railway create
   railway up --service scraper-worker

   # Option B: Deploy from GitHub (recommended)
   # Connect your GitHub repo in Railway dashboard
   # Set root directory to "scraper-worker"
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard:
   ```env
   UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=rediss://default:xxx@xxx.upstash.io:6379
   WORKER_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
   TMDB_API_KEY=your-tmdb-api-key
   VERCEL_CALLBACK_SECRET=another-secret-for-callbacks
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Generate Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Generate random secrets
   openssl rand -base64 32  # For WORKER_SECRET
   openssl rand -base64 32  # For VERCEL_CALLBACK_SECRET
   ```

5. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically build using the Dockerfile
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Note the deployment URL (e.g., `https://scraper-worker-production.up.railway.app`)

## Phase 3: Update Vercel Configuration

1. **Add Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   ```env
   WORKER_URL=https://scraper-worker-production.up.railway.app
   WORKER_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
   VERCEL_CALLBACK_SECRET=another-secret-for-callbacks
   VERCEL_URL=https://imdb-migrator.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Redeploy Vercel**:
   - Trigger a new deployment to pick up environment variables
   - Either push to main branch or use Vercel dashboard

## Phase 4: Test the Integration

1. **Test Worker Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://scraper-worker-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return healthy status.

2. **Test Job Queue**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://scraper-worker-production.up.railway.app/jobs \\
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORKER_SECRET" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{
       "imdbUserId": "ur31595220",
       "forceRefresh": true
     }'
   ```

3. **Test Vercel Integration**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://imdb-migrator.vercel.app/api/sync
   ```
   Should return job ID instead of direct scraping.

4. **Test Stremio Addon**:
   - Install addon: `https://imdb-migrator.vercel.app/api/stremio/ur31595220/manifest.json?v=2.0.0`
   - Should show populated watchlist after worker completes

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Railway Logs
```bash
railway logs -s scraper-worker
```

### Vercel Logs
Check Vercel dashboard for function logs.

### Health Checks
- Worker: `GET /health`
- Worker Metrics: `GET /health/metrics`
- Redis: Check Upstash dashboard

### Common Issues

**1. Worker Service Unreachable**
- Check Railway deployment status
- Verify WORKER_URL in Vercel env vars
- Test health endpoint directly

**2. Authentication Errors**
- Verify WORKER_SECRET matches between Railway and Vercel
- Check Authorization header format

**3. Redis Connection Issues**
- Verify UPSTASH_REDIS_URL is correct
- Check Upstash dashboard for connection metrics

**4. Browser Launch Failures**
- Check Railway logs for missing dependencies
- Verify Dockerfile is using playwright:focal base image

**5. Empty Watchlist Results**
- Check if IMDb user ID is public
- Verify TMDB_API_KEY is valid
- Check worker logs for scraping errors

## Cost Breakdown

- **Upstash Redis**: Free tier (10K commands/day)
- **Railway**: $5/month (starter plan)
- **Vercel**: Free (existing)
- **Total**: $5/month additional cost

## Architecture Benefits

âœ… **Serverless Compatibility**: Browser automation runs in proper container
âœ… **Performance**: Vercel serves cached results instantly
âœ… **Reliability**: Queue-based processing with retries
âœ… **Scalability**: Can add more worker instances
âœ… **Cost Effective**: Only $5/month vs $30-50/month for managed services
âœ… **Monitoring**: Full observability and health checks

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily disable the worker:

1. **Remove Environment Variables** from Vercel:
   - Remove `WORKER_URL` and `WORKER_SECRET`
   - This will make catalog endpoints return empty arrays

2. **Alternative: Feature Flag**:
   ```env
   USE_WORKER=false
   ```
   Then update catalog code to check this flag.

3. **Complete Rollback**:
   - Revert to previous version (1.36.0)
   - Re-enable direct scraping code

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Check Railway metrics for memory/CPU usage
2. **Scale if Needed**: Add more Railway instances for heavy usage
3. **Add More Users**: Extend to support multiple IMDb accounts
4. **Automate**: Set up periodic sync cron jobs
5. **Cache Optimization**: Implement smarter caching strategies

## Success Criteria

âœ… Worker service healthy and responding
âœ… Redis queue processing jobs
âœ… Vercel returning job IDs for sync requests
âœ… Stremio addon showing populated watchlists
âœ… No browser automation errors in logs
âœ… Response times under 500ms for cached data

Your IMDb scraper is now production-ready with proper browser automation! ðŸš€
